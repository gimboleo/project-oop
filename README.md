### A simple, text-based adventure game made in 1 day for the Object-oriented programming course at UWr's Institute of Computer Science
Programming language: [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)

## Lore
### The world is indeed comic, but the joke is on mankind.
You woke up in the middle of a dingy, dark room. You have no idea where you are or who you are. A simple wooden sword lies beside you. Will you persist and find a way out of this unpleasant place or perish to the Eldtrich abominations lurking in the shadows?

## Premise
### TL;DR: Find a way out of the dungeon!
Your goal is to escape the dreadful place he was thrown in. The game is entirely text-based, so you'll be using commands at your disposal to move around and interact with the world. Along the way you will find useful items, dangerous enemies, and hopefully, an exit.
