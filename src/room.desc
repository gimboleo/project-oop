Room full of odd pillars. Water rushes down from several holes in the ceiling and falls through similar holes in the floor. The floor is damp and looks slippery.
This small chamber is a bloody mess. The corpse of an another human lies on the floor, his belly carved out. Bloody, froglike footprints track away from the corpse and into the darkness. 
You enter a small room and your steps echo. Looking about, you're uncertain why, but then a wall vanishes and reveals an enormous chamber. It's really dark in here.
